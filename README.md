# Obsidian GraphForge

Automatically creates and maintain's a graph view of your notes, if their
organized into folders. Allowing for folders to be the root node, which just makes
sense visually. Additionally provides a quick access hub note display for each
folder.

### HOW IT WORKS?

Creates a note for each folder (hidden by default). These act as
folder nodes in graph view that all notes inside their folders attach to. Links to
each hub note get added at the top of notes, connecting them together to their
folder node. Options to customize the feel of the workflow to your liking.
